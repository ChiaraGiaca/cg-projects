# Computer Graphics projects
This repository contains my development of the homeworks of Computer Graphics concerning the topics of image filtering, raytracing, procedural modeling and animation.

All the code is written in C++ and using the Yocto/GL library (more information is available here: https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl).<br /> 
The following are some of the results achieved in these projects.
